After months of struggling to analayze the data viewed in my Visual Basic applications from Access,
I have finally made a major breakthrough with querying the data in my tables and writing reports in
the form of .txt files which include the name "CommissionReport" in them along with the date and employee
ID number.

In order to run this application, just make sure you have the 32-bit Microsoft Access Runtime installed on
your machine, and double click the .exe file. Make sure as you use the application to enter into it good
data, for while there may be good data validation, it is limited.

Thank you for your time.
